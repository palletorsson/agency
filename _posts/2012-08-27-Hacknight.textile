summery: The most central single agency of my research became the hackerspace, Sparvnästet as I was able to follow and collaboratively form issues, projects, and ideas with the group to be included in my research. Starting in March and ending in Late Summer 2012, I co-organised a “hacknight” with Sparvnästet and Museum of Technology (Tekniska Museet) in Stockholm. The hacknight, we named, make all, was an around-the-clock open conference with lectures, workshops and many practical situations for experimenting and learning. The event was recently mentioned as the starting point of the maker movement in Stockholm, in the internationally renowned Maker Magazine. It was the second project that I decided to include in my research. The making of hacknight made it possible for me to develop and describe the differences between the hacker net-activist agency of Sparvnästet, and the liberal innovation coded maker agency of the Museum of Technology. A reworked article called “Hacknight”[2] was later peer reviewed and accepted for the Journal of Nordic Museology in 2014.
